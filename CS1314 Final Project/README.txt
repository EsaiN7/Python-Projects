This was my final project for Python CS1314, I made a snake game using the PyGame Library - PyGame is super fun
and simple to use, highly recommend to anyone interested in making simple python games.

To run this code you need PyGame installed on your machine. You can do this using the following command:

pip3 install pygame

Thanks for checking this out!
